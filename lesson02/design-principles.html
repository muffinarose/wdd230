                    The city of Renton uses a circular logo. 
                    The website repeats the circle design multiple times. 
                    The main selections below the hero image are all enclosed in circles. 
                    In addition to this, the language button and search bar at the top 
                    have rounded ends, that help to tie them in with other circular 
                    elements on the page.

                    Apple is well known for their beautiful, simple designs. 
                    Their web site is no exception. They use striking photographs, 
                    limited text, and simple fonts. 
                    All of this is surrounded by ample negative space 
                    (The “white space” is not always white) which 
                    highlights and compliments the featured products.

                    Disney is a large and far-reaching company. When you visit the Disney page, 
                    they simplify choices, by presenting only four menu buttons. These choices will 
                    get almost all visitors to where they want to go; The Disney+ streaming service, 
                    The online Disney store, information on Disney parks and travel, and finally, 
                    the Disney movies. 
                    This removes excess choices and distractions, allowing users to get where 
                    they want to go quickly. 
                    There are other options, but they have been hidden behind a small, unobtrusive
                    hamburger button, so as not to distract form the four main options.
