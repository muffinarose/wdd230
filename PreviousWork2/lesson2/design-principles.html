                <p>
                    The home page of the Best Buy website features a simple grid 
                    of repeating circles with images in them. 
                    Each circle represents a specific category and is a clickable 
                    link that directs to that category's page. 
                    Circles are repeated throughout the web site used for many 
                    other things, including subcategories, customer service, 
                    and the social media links in the site footer.

                <p>
                    Apple is well known for their beautiful, simple designs. 
                    Their web site is no exception. They use striking photographs, 
                    limited text, and simple fonts. 
                    All of this is surrounded by ample negative space 
                    (in this case, the “white space” is not always white) which 
                    highlights and compliments the featured products.

                <p>
                    FedEx has simplified their home page so that visitors can quickly and 
                    easily do what they are most likely there for, eliminating too much choice. 
                    Right at the top there are 3 main buttons for the three most likely 
                    reasons a user would visit: shipping, tracking, and finding a store. 
                    In addition to this, there is another big, bright button right in the 
                    middle that is also for tracking. 
                    Other options can be found in the peripheries, but don't distract from 
                    the three main options.
