            <h3>City of Renton WA</h3>
            <a href="https://rentonwa.gov">https://rentonwa.gov</a>

            <p>
                The Renton city logo is enclosed in a circle. 
                The designer has chosen to repeat the circle element throughout the page. 
                The language button and the search bar have been rounded, 
                and the search button is a circle. In addition to this, 
                other buttons on the site are also circles. 
                This gives cohesiveness to the whole site.

                Hick’s law states that the more choices you give a user, the 
                longer it will take them to make a choice. Disney has chosen 
                to simplify their mobile website by offering only three main 
                options in the menu bar. These are their streaming service, 
                their online store, and their parks. These three options will 
                help almost all users get where they want to go very easily and 
                very quickly. There is very little else to distract, helping 
                to keep the focus where it’s needed.

            <p>
                Woodland park zoo has utilized a very clean design with lots of open white 
                space that helps users get to where they want quickly and easily. It makes 
                things very easy navigated and looks beautiful. 
                (currently, there are mask rule and other COVID-19 related statements at 
                the top of the page above this, but during non-pandemic times, those are not present)
