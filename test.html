      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To give info to prospective customers and make it easier to book online.<br><br>
        
        The first purpose of the website is to show an overview of what to expect when going on an adventure with us. We want 
        to answer questions that prospective clients may have about the experience. <br>
        The secondary purpose is to allow both new and return customers a way to check prices, view openings, and book 
        adventures directly on the website. <br><br>
        
        Both of these purposes allow convenience for both the customer and the employees. Customers are able to look 
        up information online ahead of time, and can book adventures when an employee is not available, day or night. 
        This eases some of the work of answering questions and doing bookings over the phone.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Both prospective rafters and experienced rafters.<br><br>
        
        Prospective rafters are people looking for adventure, and to try new things. They are middle-class and new to 
        white-water rafting. They are likely new to rafting of any type, and are likely excited, but nervous about the idea. 
        Age ranges will generally be 20-40, although outliers of younger or older may be interested. They are interested 
        in learning about white-water rafting in general, and what to expect overall.<br><br>
        
        Experienced rafters will be those that have been on one or more white-water adventures before. They are also 
        middle-class, and they’re age range is also the same as prospective rafters, with most clients being 20-40 years old.
        These people have a good idea what they are looking for and want to know specifics about our company, and our adventures.

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/227c9d-558844-eec643-022864-8de2d6" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/227c9d-558844-eec643-022864-8de2d6</a></p>

        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr><td class="primary">[#227C9D]</td><td class="secondary">[#558844]</td><td class="accent1">[#EEC643]</td><td class="accent2">[#011638]</td></tr>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Trade Winds  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I picked Trade Winds because it is a font with a bit of fun. It conveys a sense of adventure, but is still 
        fairly easy to read. 
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Poppins <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose a sans seriff font to make sure that it is easily and comfortably readable on screens. 
        I didn't want this font to be particularily noticeable, and I wanted it to be distinct from the 
        heading font.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
